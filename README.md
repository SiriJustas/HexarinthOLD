# Hexarinth
Hexagon labyrinth generator made in pure JAVA + Swing, adopted in C# and unity.

Generation is made by Reverse BackTracking<br />
End point is set by Reverse Djikstra to make correct path as long as possible<br />
Starting point is RED, ending point is BLUE<br />
Controlling = Mouse (click/drag) keyboard makes it different because of 6 possible ways or you can print it and solve it by your hand (JAVA version) and ARROWS (Unity/C# version) <br />
Generation size is limited only in the interface mode, you can change limits in code by yourself. <br />

Lots of comments for debugging (as always), sorry for that
